# Machine Learning Algorithms in Details

The ML Algorithms in Detail repository is a comprehensive resource for learning about various machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is a rapidly growing field that is transforming industries by providing automated solutions to complex problems. However, understanding the nuances of different machine learning algorithms can be challenging. That's why we created this repository as a one-stop-shop for learning about various machine learning algorithms in detail. By providing in-depth explanations, code examples, and a community-driven approach, we aim to make learning about machine learning algorithms both accessible and enjoyable.

The repository is organized into different directories for each category of algorithms. The categories include:

**Classification algorithms:**

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks

**Regression algorithms:**

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression

**Clustering algorithms:**

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

**Dimension Reduction algorithms:**

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)


In each directory, you will find a detailed description of the algorithm, including its mathematical formulation, the assumptions it makes, its strengths, and its limitations. Additionally, we provide code examples in various programming languages (such as Python, R, and MATLAB) to help you implement the algorithm in your projects.

Each algorithm is presented in a structured and organized way, with clear explanations, illustrations, and code examples. We also provide references to additional resources for those who want to dive deeper into a particular topic.

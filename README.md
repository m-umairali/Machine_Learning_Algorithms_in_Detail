# Machine Learning Algorithms in Details

- Welcome to the ML Algorithms in Detail repository, where you can learn about various machine learning algorithms in-depth. This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of different machine learning models, including their underlying principles, mathematical formulations, and implementation details.

- We cover a wide range of topics, from classical machine learning algorithms to advance deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Each algorithm is presented in a structured and organized way, with clear explanations, illustrations, and code examples.

- Our goal is to help you gain a deeper understanding of how machine learning algorithms work, so you can apply them effectively to your own projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, you'll find valuable insights and practical tips in this repository.

- We welcome contributions from the community, so if you have a favorite algorithm you'd like to write about or if you spot an error or improvement, please feel free to submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
